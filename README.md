# E-Commerce Clothing Store (E-prj)

## Description
A responsive online shopping mall for clothing, built as a web application. Users can browse categories, view products, and interact with basic forms. Developed during my full-stack internship at Cognifyz.

## Features

- Responsive design for mobile/desktop.
- Basic form validation using JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
- Inline styles with server-side interaction basics (Node.js Express).

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Node.js (for basic server setup)

## Live Demo
